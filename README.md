Asteroids!

This is a Game that I made (cloned from the Atari Game) as an android app.

# Future Work

* Something I could have done better: getting experienced developer help at a more ideal time (I got help, but I would have gotten a lot farther if I had reached out a little earlier)
* Future plans: 
    - Make the game playable with user interaction
    - Change MainActivity to be a workable 'main menu' screen
    - clean up the code I currently have and make the files cleaner
